# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

##Project and Raw Dat
1. This repository contains the R code and fileas for the course "Getting and Cleaning data"

2. The raw data is about Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKINGUPSTAIRS, WALKINGDOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist) The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

##Files
1. CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data

2. Run_analysis.R This file is the code and how it works

3. TestTrainaverages.txt is the output data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
